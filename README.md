# 🚑 Emergency Priority Routing Engine (EPRE)

An AI-assisted ambulance routing and decision-support system designed to reduce emergency response time during the critical **Golden Hour**.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

During medical emergencies, ambulances often get delayed due to traffic congestion, lack of route prioritization, and absence of ambulance-specific navigation systems. Generic navigation apps are optimized for civilian travel, not emergency response, leading to avoidable delays and loss of life.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

Emergency Priority Routing Engine (EPRE) provides a **dedicated emergency command interface** for ambulance operators. It enables hospital discovery, multi-route visualization, ETA prediction, and intelligent route recommendations optimized specifically for emergency scenarios.

EPRE prioritizes **time-to-hospital and Golden Hour preservation**, rather than general traffic convenience.

## ✨ Key Features

* Ambulance login via unique ID / authentication
* Real-time map-based navigation interface
* Nearby hospital discovery
* Multiple route visualization
* AI-assisted best route recommendation
* ETA prediction using live traffic data
* Golden Hour mission tracking dashboard
* Scalable and modular system design

---

## 🧠 AI & Decision Logic

* Uses **Google Maps AI-powered routing and traffic intelligence** for ETA and congestion analysis
* Rule-based decision engine ensures **explainable and reliable** route recommendations
* Optimized for emergency response rather than civilian navigation

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Google Technologies Used

* Google Maps JavaScript API
* Google Places API
* Firebase Authentication
* Firebase Firestore
* Firebase Hosting

### Frontend

* Web-based UI (Emergency Command Interface)

---

## 🧩 System Architecture

The system consists of three main layers:

1. **Client Layer** – Ambulance driver web interface
2. **Backend & Logic Layer** – Authentication, data handling, and decision engine
3. **Google Services Layer** – Maps, routing, traffic intelligence

(Refer to architecture diagram in the project presentation.)
